  firstParagraph: `I began my programming journey in 2018 with web development, then
  gradually expanded my knowledge by learning C# and Python to grasp
  the core concepts of programming. In 2020, while studying at
  university, I delved deeper into systems through Java, C/C++, Unix,
  and databases. This newfound knowledge enabled me to create software
  projects for assignments and personal projects, and continue to
  improve my skills.`,
  secondParagraph: `In my spare time, I enjoy calisthenics and staying fit, as well as
  playing video games and watching anime. Additionally, I have a keen
  interest in the fields of machine learning and chess.`,
